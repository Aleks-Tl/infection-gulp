            <div class="aboutus__title title">Our Founder</div>
            <div class="aboutus__decription">
              <p>As a teenager our founder John spent many Friday and Saturday nights helping his chef mother do the end
                of day clean and next day prep in a hotel’s commercial kitchen. This work placed him in a good position
                to support himself at university through working as commercial cleaner in public restrooms, aged care
                facilities, public & private hospitals, surgical units, respite centres, private medical centres, and
                the government buildings in Melbourne. During Johns’ science degree at Victoria University, he developed
                a professional knowledge of cross contamination through his studies in microbiology and pathophysiology.
                Following completion of his science degree John worked as a fulltime surgical unit cleaner and head of
                Kyneton hospital cleaning services for Central highlands regional health.
              </p>
              <p>In 2008 John lost his sister Jennifer (aged 52) to sequela of a gastroenteritis infection. Coronial
                investigation confirmed cross contamination with GII.4 Norovirus resulting in gastroparesis and
                formation of a bezoar which was fatal due to the development of pericarditis and resultant cardiac
                tamponade.
              </p>
              <p>The loss of Jenifer due to a cross contamination of Norovirus within a hospital motivated John to get a
                Certificate III in commercial cleaning practice, a certificate of Infection Prevention and Control from
                the Australasian College of infection Prevention and Control (ACIPC) and Grad Cert in Infection
                Prevention and Containment (IPC) from Griffith University.
              </p>
              <p>As the founder of Infection Professionals John has a strong and deeply personal motivation to ensure
                the highest standard of cleaning and sanitation so that other families do not have to lose loved ones
                because of low standard environmental cleaning and poor IPC practice standards.
